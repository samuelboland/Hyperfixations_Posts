## Introduction

A quick post on my CircleCI config. This config allowed me to generate code coverage for Jest and Cypress and upload that coverage to Codecov from CircleCI.

## The Config

The actual file can be found here: <https://github.com/samuelboland/Hyperfixations/blob/getCypressWorkingOnCircleCI/.circleci/config.yml>

The key components were solved in previous posts, specifically the esm piece in my last one. Once I got that working, this part just fell together.

Sorry that this post is so short, I've got some major refactoring to do. I just spent the last few days trying to get Cypress testing to play nicely, and non-hackily, with authentication, so that I can protect this New Post route.

I've decided it's too much hassle and I'm going to move to a CMS, perhaps a markdown based local one, or perhaps a service like Strapi. This gets rid of the need for authentication completely.
