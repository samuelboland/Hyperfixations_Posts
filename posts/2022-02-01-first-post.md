- [My very first post](#my-very-first-post)

## My very first post

I'm writing this from the rich text editor that I just wired up. This is wonderful, I love this! I'm using Tiptap (https://tiptap.dev/) which bills itself as "_The headless editor framework for web artisans."_

I have it set up as a component that I can call from within a "/blog/new" route (which, btw, is protected by Next Auth, so only I can see it). It continually returns the state to the parent component, which means that I can use it inside a form just like any other text input!

This is a very exciting moment. :)
